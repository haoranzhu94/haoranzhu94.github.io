I am a last year PhD student in the Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, working with [Jeff Linderoth](https://jlinderoth.github.io/) and [Alberto Del Pia](https://sites.google.com/site/albertodelpia/home). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from Nanjing University in 2016 and my M.S. in Computer Sciences from UW-Madison in 2020.


I am interested in broad areas of optimization with more focus on discrete and combinatorial optimization. Most of my latest work are centered around the development and study of polyhedral relaxations for a variety of nonconvex sets that appear frequently in a variety of optimization problems.
