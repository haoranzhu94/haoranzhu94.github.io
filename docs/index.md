I am currently an Applied Scientist at Microsoft. Previously I was a PhD student in the Department of [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/industrial-systems-engineering/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/), working with [Jeff Linderoth](https://jlinderoth.github.io/) and [Alberto Del Pia](https://sites.google.com/site/albertodelpia/home). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) in 2016 and my M.S. in Computer Sciences from UW-Madison in 2020.


I am interested in broad areas of optimization with more focus on discrete and combinatorial optimization. Most of my latest work are centered around the development and study of polyhedral relaxations for a variety of nonconvex sets that appear frequently in different optimization problems. For more details, you can see my [statement of research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BgKvPZ6cJz-s6XqEneiaTX_FyR0BBvFr/view?usp=sharing) here.

# Other Stuff

In my spare time, other than research and work, I am also actively engaged in all kinds of physical sports and activities. Soccer, running, hiking and swimming are some of my favorites. I am also competitive in bodybuilding and powerlifting. Sometimes I like posting videos in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/peterzhuuuuu/?hl=zh-cn).
